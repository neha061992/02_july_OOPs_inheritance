   "source": [
    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class can inherit\n",
    "properties and behaviors from only one parent class. In other words, a derived class can have only\n",
    "one immediate base class. This creates a linear hierarchy of classes, where each class\n",
    "extends the one directly above it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Single inheritance keeps the class hierarchy straightforward and easy to follow.\n",
    "            There's no ambiguity about which parent class's attributes and methods are inherited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: While limited to a single parent, single inheritance still allows for code reuse. \n",
    "                  Derived classes can inherit and modify the behavior of their parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Diamond Problem: The diamond problem is a complication that arises in multiple inheritance \n",
    "                          when a class inherits from two classes that have a common base class. In single \n",
    "                          inheritance, this problem is avoided altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is another OOP concept where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from more \n",
    "than one parent class. This leads to a complex hierarchy of classes, with each class potentially inheriting\n",
    "from multiple classes. This can be powerful for creating complex relationships and sharing functionality among\n",
    "different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Functionality: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit features from multiple sources, enabling \n",
    "                        the creation of rich and versatile classes that combine characteristics of different parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance allows for a higher degree of code reuse, as a class can inherit attributes\n",
    "                  and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixins and Interfaces: Multiple inheritance is often used to implement mixins or interfaces. Mixins are small classes\n",
    "                       that provide specific behaviors that can be added to multiple classes, enhancing modularity and\n",
    "                       reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Parents: The primary difference between single and multiple inheritance is the number of parent classes a derived class can inherit from. Single inheritance allows only one parent class, while multiple inheritance allows multiple parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchy Complexity: Multiple inheritance can lead to complex class hierarchies and introduce ambiguity, especially when conflicts arise due to naming collisions or method overrides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamond Problem: As mentioned earlier, the diamond problem is a specific issue that can occur in multiple inheritance when two classes with a common base class are inherited by a single derived class. This can result in ambiguity regarding method resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, single inheritance simplifies class hierarchies and avoids complications like the diamond problem, while multiple inheritance provides greater flexibility and code reuse, albeit with increased complexity and the potential for conflicts. The choice between single and multiple inheritance depends on the specific design goals and requirements of the software being developed.\n"

    "\n",
    "**1. Private Access Modifier:**\n",
    "Members marked as private are only accessible within the class where they are defined. They cannot be accessed or modified from outside the class, including derived classes.

    "**Significance of the \"Protected\" Access Modifier in Inheritance:**\n",

Protected members give derived classes access to the internals of the base class, while still preventing unrestricted access from outside the class hierarchy.\n",
